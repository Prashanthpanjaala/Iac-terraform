# Iac-terraform

**Terraform** is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool created by **HashiCorp**. It allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language called **HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)** or optionally JSON.

### 🔧 What Terraform Does
Terraform helps manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers (like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), as well as services like Kubernetes, GitHub, or even on-premises setups. It can:
- Create and manage virtual machines
- Set up networking
- Manage DNS, firewalls, databases, etc.
- Automate deployment of cloud resources

### 🧱 How It Works (Key Concepts)
- **Providers**: Plugins that let Terraform interact with APIs (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
- **Resources**: The building blocks (like `aws_instance`, `google_storage_bucket`).
- **Modules**: Reusable configurations, kind of like functions in programming.
- **State**: Terraform keeps track of what's deployed using a state file (local or remote).
- **Plan & Apply**: You run `terraform plan` to preview changes and `terraform apply` to execute them.

### ✅ Benefits
- **Repeatability**: Infrastructure setup is consistent and reproducible.
- **Version control**: Configs are just text files—easy to store in Git.
- **Automation-friendly**: Works well with CI/CD pipelines.
- **Multi-cloud**: Manage multiple platforms with a single tool.

### 🔁 A Typical Workflow
1. Write configuration files (`.tf`)
2. Initialize with `terraform init`
3. Preview changes with `terraform plan`
4. Apply changes with `terraform apply`
5. Destroy infrastructure with `terraform destroy` (when needed)



Sure! Here's a breakdown of **Docker** in a simple, no-fluff way:

---

### 🐳 What Is Docker?

**Docker** is a platform that lets you **package, distribute, and run applications in containers**. Think of containers as lightweight, portable virtual machines—but way faster and more efficient.

---

### ⚙️ Why Use Docker?

- **Consistency**: Works the same on your laptop, in testing, and in production.
- **Isolation**: Each app runs in its own environment, with its own dependencies.
- **Portability**: Containers can run anywhere Docker is installed.
- **Speed**: Containers start up quickly compared to VMs.
- **Efficiency**: Uses fewer system resources.

### 🔍 Key Concepts

| Concept        | What It Is                                                  |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Image**      | A snapshot of your app and its environment. Read-only.      |
| **Container**  | A running instance of an image. Think: process in a box.    |
| **Dockerfile** | A text file with instructions to build a Docker image.      |
| **Docker Hub** | Public registry where images are stored and shared.         |
| **Volume**     | Persistent storage for containers (data that doesn’t vanish).|
| **Network**    | Communication between containers or with the outside world. |

---

### 🧱 Typical Workflow

1. **Write a Dockerfile** – defines your app’s environment
2. **Build an image** – `docker build -t my-app .`
3. **Run a container** – `docker run -p 8080:80 my-app`
4. **Push to Docker Hub** (optional) – `docker push username/my-app`

---

### 🔥 Simple Example

**Dockerfile:**
```Dockerfile
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Then:
```bash
docker build -t my-node-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
```
